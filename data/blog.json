The alert, issued at 1:41 a.m., was meant to inform residents about a power outage but had been changed to reference the popular AMC television series The Walking Dead.'Power outage and zombie alert for residents of Lake Worth and Terminus,' the alert said. 'There are now far less than seven thousand three hundred and eighty customers involved due to extreme zombie activity. Restoration time uncertain.' City officials said the alert system was working properly but seemed to have been hacked. They are looking for who is responsible.'We are looking into the reports that the system mentioned zombies. I want to reiterate that Lake Worth does not have any zombie activity currently and apologize for the system message,' wrote Ben Kerr, the city's communication director, on a Facebook post to Lake Worth Live.He reported the power outage only lasted for 27 minutes.",

And if you've collected some extra cash, and you don't need to pad your emergency savings account or dig yourself out of debt, it's an ideal time to try your hand at investing. With that in mind, we asked a handful of financial experts to give their suggestions for investing $1,000, a low sum for a veteran investor but a decent amount for beginners.But before you start investing, remember, reaching your finance goals takes time. If you think you might need that $1,000 in a few months, adding more money to your rainy day fund is the best thing you can do. And never invest anything you can't tolerate the thought of possibly losing; after all, investing is a risk. ",
