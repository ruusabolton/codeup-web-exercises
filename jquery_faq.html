    <dt> 1.  How do I obtain a park entrance pass?
        <dd class="invisible">You can obtain park entrance passes by visiting a park site that charges an entrance fee. Entrance fee sites have passes available;
            we recommend calling a park prior to your visit. (See the park search to locate a specific park.) There are a number of entrance passes available,
            including park-specific passes as well as passes that offer entrance to more than 2,000 federal recreation sites in addition to the national
            parks (Annual, Military, Senior, 4th Grade, Access, and Volunteer passes).  </dd>
